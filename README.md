The website for rubiX club.
This was just a fun project in order to explore the field of frontend development using css and html

## Built With

* [HTML5](https://html.com/)
* [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)
* [JAVASCRIPT](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [FIREBASE](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [VantaJS](https://www.vantajs.com/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### 1. Register yourself to Hacktoberfest 2020
###### Link to register: https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/
![](https://i.ibb.co/SXFDCFm/hacktoberfest_website.png)

### 2. Get Started to start contributing
![](https://i.ibb.co/n3ftSNG/hacktoberfest_get_started.png)

### 3. Star and Fork this Repository
###### You can star ‚≠ê and fork üçΩÔ∏è this repository on GitHub by navigating at the top of this repository.
![](https://i.ibb.co/B6SsMnN/star.jpg)
###### GitHub repository URLs will reference both the username associated with the owner of the repository, as well as the repository name. 

###### When you‚Äôre on the main page for the repository, you‚Äôll see a button to "Star" and ‚ÄúFork‚Äù the repository on your upper right-hand side of the page, underneath your user icon.

### 4. Clone the Repository
###### To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let‚Äôs first open up a terminal window.
###### We‚Äôll use the git clone command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.
###### This URL will be similar to the URL above, except now it will end with .git. In the example above, the URL will look like this:

https://github.com/dscabesit/RubiX.git

###### You can alternatively copy the URL by using the green ‚ÄúClone or download‚Äù button from your repository page that you just forked from the original repository page. Once you click the button, you‚Äôll be able to copy the URL by clicking the binder button next to the URL:
![](https://i.ibb.co/zb6JnJN/clone.jpg)

###### Once we have the URL, we‚Äôre ready to clone the repository. To do this, we‚Äôll combine the git clone command with the repository URL from the command line in a terminal window:
```
git clone https://github.com/dscabesit/RubiX.git
```

### 5. Create New Branch
###### Once the project is opened create a new branch and checkout in it where you can make the changes in the code.
###### You can do this either from terminal or Directly in your text editor.
###### To do from Terminal:
```
git branch new-branch
git checkout new-branch
```

### 6. Commit and Push
###### After making the required changes commit and push your code
###### Terminal:
###### To add the changes after you have made the modifications
``` git add . ``` or ``` git add -A ```
###### To commit and push the changes
```
git commit -m <Your-commit-message>
```
```
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
```

### 7. Update Local Repository
###### While working on a project alongside other contributors, it is important for you to keep your local repository up-to-date with the project as you don‚Äôt want to make a pull request for code that will cause conflicts. To keep your local copy of the code base updated, you‚Äôll need to sync changes.
###### We‚Äôll first go over configuring a remote for the fork, then syncing the fork.

### 8. Configure a Remote for the Fork
###### You‚Äôll have to specify a new remote upstream repository for us to sync with the fork. This will be the original repository that you forked from. you‚Äôll have to do this with the git remote add command.
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dscabesit/RubiX
```
###### In this example, // upstream // is the shortname we have supplied for the remote repository since in terms of Git, ‚Äúupstream‚Äù refers to the repository that you cloned from. If you want to add a remote pointer to the repository of a collaborator, you may want to provide that collaborator‚Äôs username or a shortened nickname for the shortname.

### 9. Sync the Fork
###### Once you have configured a remote that references the upstream and original repository on GitHub, you are ready to sync your fork of the repository to keep it up-to-date.
To sync your fork, from the directory of your local repository in a terminal window, you‚Äôll have to use the // git fetch // command to fetch the branches along with their respective commits from the upstream repository. Since you used the shortname ‚Äúupstream‚Äù to refer to the upstream repository, you‚Äôll have to pass that to the command:

``` git fetch upstream ```
###### Switch to the local master branch of our repository:
``` git checkout master ```
###### Now merge any changes that were made in the original repository‚Äôs master branch, that you will access through your local upstream/master branch, with your local master branch:
``` git merge upstream/master ```

### 10. Create Pull Request
###### At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.
###### Now navigate to your forked repository, and press the ‚ÄúNew pull request‚Äù button on your left-hand side of the page.
